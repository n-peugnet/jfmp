## Install from sources

### Requirements

As the wheel for music-player-core is not yet provided you have to build it yourself from sources, this is why you need these requirements:

* boost >=1.55.0
* ffmpeg >= 2.0 (including libswresample)
* portaudio >=v19
* chromaprint

#### Debian and derivatives

```bash
apt-get install python-dev libsnappy-dev libtool yasm libchromaprint-dev portaudio19-dev libboost-dev

# FFmpeg
apt-get install libavformat-dev libavresample-dev
```

### Install and build

    git clone https://github.com/n-peugnet/jfmp
    pip install --user pipenv
    pipenv install

_Note: if you want to use your system theme you will have to symlink your virtualenv's `PySide2` folder to your system one. It is probably located around `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PySide2`._

### Run

    pipenv run ./main.py
